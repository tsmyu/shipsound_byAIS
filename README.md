# AIS and WAV Processing Project

This project is designed to process AIS (Automatic Identification System) data, WAV audio files, and associated metadata to analyze vessel trajectories, calculate distances, cut relevant audio segments, and generate visualizations like geolocation plots and time-averaged spectrograms. The project is modular, with functionalities separated across multiple files and configured via a central TOML file.

## Modules Overview

### `data_processing.py`
Contains functions for reading and processing AIS data, converting timestamps, and complementing vessel trajectories with interpolated data.

### `distance_calculation.py`
Contains functions to calculate the shortest distance between vessels and the recording position, using the Haversine formula.

### `visualization.py`
Includes functions for generating visualizations:
- **Geolocation Plots:** Show vessel trajectories relative to the recording point.
- **Time-Averaged Spectrograms:** Display the frequency content of the mother source WAV file over its entire duration. For long files, the spectrogram represents time-averaged power spectral density to manage memory usage. Vertical lines indicate the calculated cut sections for nearby vessels.

### `audio_processing.py`
Contains functions to cut WAV audio files based on calculated time ranges (derived from vessel proximity) and generate corresponding metadata appendix files. The cutting process considers multiple conditions:

1. **Time Range Selection:** The time range for each cut is centered around the time of minimum distance between the vessel and recording position.
2. **Distance Threshold:** Only vessels that come within a configurable maximum distance (`max_cut_distance` in config.toml) are considered for cutting.
3. **Isolation Condition:** A vessel segment is only cut when, at its time of minimum distance, it is the closest vessel to the recording position (compared to all other vessels).
4. **Margin Configuration:** The time margin before and after the minimum distance point is configurable (`cut_margin_minutes` in config.toml).

The cut WAV files are stored with metadata about the vessel, including MMSI, vessel type, vessel name, minimum distance, and timestamps.

### `main.py`
The main script that integrates all modules. It reads the configuration from `config.toml`, executes the pipeline (reading data, calculating distances, optionally creating visualizations and cutting WAV files based on the config), and saves the results.

### `config.toml`
A configuration file using the TOML format to set parameters for various processing steps, such as file paths, calculation thresholds, plot settings, and output flags (e.g., whether to generate figures or cut audio). This allows easy modification of the project's behavior without changing the code.

Key audio processing parameters include:
- `cut_margin_minutes`: The time margin (in minutes) before and after the point of minimum distance for WAV cutting
- `max_cut_distance`: Maximum distance threshold (in meters) for vessel consideration
- `check_other_vessels`: Whether to check if a vessel is the closest at its minimum distance time

## Requirements

1.  **Python:** (Specify version if applicable, e.g., Python 3.8+ recommended)
2.  **Dependencies:** Install the necessary libraries using `requirements.txt`:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Configuration File:** A `config.toml` file must be present in the project root directory. You can copy and modify the provided template or create your own based on the required parameters. See `config.toml.template` (if provided) or the parameter usage within the scripts for details.

## Usage

To execute the pipeline, run the `main.py` script, providing the necessary command-line arguments:

```bash
python main.py -a AIS_PATH -w WAV_PATH -m TOML_PATH -t RECORD_START_TIME [-c CONFIG_PATH] [-ff] [-mf] [-cf]
```

### Command-line Arguments

The script accepts the following arguments:

- `-a`, `--ais_path` (required): Path to the folder containing AIS data CSV files.
- `-w`, `--wav_path` (required): Path to the folder containing WAV audio files.
- `-m`, `--toml_path` (required): Path to the TOML metadata file with observation information.
- `-t`, `--record_start_time` (required): Record start time in ISO format (e.g., '2024-03-19T06:53:00').
- `-c`, `--config_path` (optional): Path to the configuration TOML file. Defaults to 'config.toml'.
- `-ff`, `--fig_flag` (flag): Generate visualization figures (geolocation plots and spectrograms).
- `-mf`, `--movie_flag` (flag): Generate movies (not currently implemented).
- `
